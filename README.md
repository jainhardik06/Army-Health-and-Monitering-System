# Army Health and Monitoring System

## Introduction
The **Army Health and Monitoring System** is a hardware project designed to monitor and track the health and location of military personnel during missions. This system captures vital health metrics, environmental conditions, and provides an emergency alert mechanism to ensure the safety and well-being of soldiers in the field.

## Features
- **Health Monitoring**: Tracks pulse and body temperature.
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Measures temperature, moisture, and light conditions around the personnel.
- **Location Tracking**: Uses a GPS tracker with a GSM module to report the soldier's location.
- **Emergency Alerts**: An emergency push button that, when pressed, sends a notification to headquarters indicating the soldier is in danger.
- **Display**: Shows real-time data on an LCD display with I2C interface.

## Hardware Components
- **DHT11 Sensor**: Measures temperature and humidity.
- **LDR Sensor**: Detects light conditions.
- **Pulse Sensor**: Monitors heart rate.
- **Arduino Uno**: The main microcontroller for processing and control.
- **GPS Tracker with GSM Sensor**: Tracks and communicates the location of the personnel.
- **LCD Display with I2C**: Displays real-time health and environmental data.
- **Emergency Push Button**: Sends an alert in case of emergency.

## Software
- **IDE**: Arduino Software (IDE)
- **Programming Language**: C++
